# mikrokat

**A minimal meta-framework for deploying portable edge functions.**

Mikrokat compiles a universal request handler into platform-specific edge runtimes, letting you write once and deploy anywhere. Designed for zero-config simplicity with maximum flexibility.

- Multi-platform build targets, currently supports: Cloudflare, Vercel, Fastly and Netlify.
- Unified API handler - Write a single `onFetch` handler that works across platforms.
- Mini virtual filesystem - Bundle config files directly into your edge function (WIP). 
- Bindable services - Unified access to services like databases, AI, and payments (WIP).

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize your project

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
mikrokat init
```

This creates a `package.json` with dependencies and a default `server.js` entrypoint.  
You'll need to manually install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Add a deployment target

```bash
mikrokat init --target=cloudflare
```

This will:
- Create a platform-specific config (e.g. `wrangler.json`)
- Add scripts to `package.json` like `dev:cloudflare` and `deploy:cloudflare`

### 3. Run and deploy your app

```bash
npm run dev:cloudflare
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```


## Writing Your Handler

Your `server.js` should export a single async function named `onFetch`. It receives `{request, env}` and returns a standard `Response`.

```js
export async function onFetch({request, env}) {
  return new Response("Hello from mikrokat!");
}
```

## Mini Filesystem (WIP)

The virtual filesystem makes it possible to include configuration or other static files directly in your edge deployment, which is essential for platforms that donâ€™t support traditional file access.

You can bundle additional files (e.g. `config.json` or other config files) into your edge functions.

```bash
mikrokat build --files=config.json,info.txt
```

These files are available at runtime using:

```js
const config = JSON.parse(ev.fs.readFileSync("config.json", "utf-8"));
```

This allows edge functions to access configuration or data without requiring a traditional file system.

## Bindable Services (WIP)

Bindable services provide a unified interface to external resources like databases, AI models, or payments, allowing your code to stay portable and vendor-agnostic - helping you avoid lock-in to specific platform APIs.

Mikrokat will support service bindings through a unified runtime interface. Example:

```js
const result = await env.DB.query("SELECT * FROM users");
const summary = await env.AI.complete({ prompt: "Summarize this" });
await env.PAYMENT.charge({ amount: 1000, currency: "USD" });
```

This enables writing portable code that integrates with external services (databases, AI, payments, vector search, etc.) without platform-specific boilerplate.
